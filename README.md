### About the project
After using [monkeytype](https://monkeytype.com) for a while I wanted a way to be able to practice my typing speed for coding instead of just for text,
because of the special charecters and patters used in code, whilst not being used in regular text.
So I decided to make my own solution which fetches code from github and displays it on the screen.
A lot of the visual styles are inspired by monkeytype, because it is my favorite site for typing practice.
The text (or code) is fetched and then cached allowing for instant restarting.

### Steps to build (Its that easy)
> npm install

> npm run build

### Possible future plans (most unlikely)
- [ ] Better UI (more explaining on what things do)
- [ ] More similarities to vscode typing
- [ ] Replays
- [ ] Leaderboards
- [ ] Versus (aka 2 player mode)
